# Karyotype Comparator

+ Enter two karyotypes to analyze for differences and similarities; multiple cell lines are allowed.
+ Ignore breakpoints option allows parsing without considering breakpoints, since these may not be identically assigned by different cytogeneticists.
+ The proofreader does not support ISCN anomalies written in long form and does not reliably parse complex derivatives.  It is unfinished but serviceable.
